<h1>osTicket - Prerequisites and Installation</h1>
In this tutorial I will outline the prerequisites and installation of the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.


<h2>Objectives</h2>

-  More Experience with Azure (I will Create the environment here)
-  Experience as both the administrator AND the user of a ticketing system
-  Gain a better understanding of all parts of ticketing system such as <b>Tickets properties, SLAs, Departments, Permissions</b> and <b>Users</b>.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- All you need for this lab is the Azure Tenant and Subscription
    
<h2>Installation Steps</h2>

-  Step 1: Create VM1

First thing first, I will create a Research Group (RG-osTicket) in www.portal.azure.com and then create a Virtual Machine(VM1) and Azure automatically assigns me a virtual network and subnet. I chose Windows 10 as OS and 2Vcpu for my VM1 and created a username. Just a reminder that I created VM1 under RG-osTicket.

-  Step 2: Connect to VM1 using RDP

I connected to VM1 via Remote Desktop Connection using VM1's public IP address(20.51.185.57) from the Azure Portal. Then I am prompted to login and now have access to VM1. I use Remote Desktop Connection because my PC runs Windows OS but if you happen to be on a MAC I would recommend to download and Install Microsoft Remote Desktop first.

-  Step 3: Install and Enable <b>IIS</b> in Windows with CGI and common HTTP features

Internet Information Service(IIS) is essentially a web server that allows our computer to serve up websites because osTicket runs out of a website. Go to control panel -> programs -> Turn windows features on and off. Then chech up this boxes by allowing: World Wide Web Services -> Application Development Features -> CGI -> Common HTTP Features.

-  Step 4: Confirm IIS is installed

After enabling IIS in Windows WITH CGI, Common HTTP Features and IIS Management Console, I open a web browser in VM1 and type 127.0.0.1 to check if my web server is up and I have a result looking like this

-  Step 5: Download and Install PHP manager for IIS and other programs

From the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6">Installation Files</a>, 1->download and install <b>PHP Manager for IIS (PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi)</b>. 2->Download and install the <b>Rewrite Module (rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi)<b>. Create the directory C:\PHP. 3->Download and install <b>PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip)</b> and unzip the contents into C:\PHP created previously. 4->Download and install <b>VC_redist.x86.exe</b>. 5->download and install <b>MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi).</b> When isntalling MySQL I chose these configurations Typical Setup -> Launch Configuration Wizard (after install) -> Standard Configuration.

-  Step 6: Register PHP from within IIS

First, I open IIS as an admin by typing typing IIS in window search and right click(run as an administrator); then double click on PHP manager -> Register new PHP version. I choose PHP-cgi from browser. After that Reload IIS (Open IIS, Stop and Start the server)

Download osTicket from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6">Installation Files</a>
I extract and copy ‚Äúupload‚Äù folder to c:\inetpub\wwwroot. Within c:\inetpub\wwwroot, Rename ‚Äúupload‚Äù to ‚ÄúosTicket‚Äù.
I go back to IIS and reload the server, then Go to sites -> Default -> osTicket.   On the right, click ‚ÄúBrowse *:80‚Äù.  I have this image displaying which means osTicket is workingüí™

-  Step 9: download and install HeidiSQL

From the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6">Installation Files</a>, download and install HeidiSQL. Open Heidi SQL Create a new session, Connect to the session, Create a database called ‚ÄúosTicket‚Äù. Basically, Heidi SQL allows me to connect to mySQL server and I will setup a database that the osTicket is going to use.
